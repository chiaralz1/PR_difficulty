1	Geometry	t393	A d9h3 in an Euclidean space is a set K consisting of half-lines emanating from some point 0, the vertex of the d9h3. The boundary ∂K of K (consisting of half-lines called generators of the d9h3) is part of a conical surface, and is sometimes also called a d9h3. Finally, the intersection of K with a half-space containing 0 and bounded by a plane not passing through 0 is often called a d9h3. In this case the part of the plane lying inside the conical surface is called the base of the d9h3 and the part of the conical surface between the base and the vertex is called the lateral surface of the d9h3.	Cone	d9h3	t393, the branch of mathematics whose primary subject is spatial relationships and shapes of bodies. t393 studies spatial relationships and shapes, while ignoring other properties of real bodies (density, weight, colour, etc.). In its subsequent stages of development t393 also dealt with other relations and shapes of reality, similar to spatial shapes. In our own times t393 is generally understood to study any relationships or shapes that appear in the study of homogeneous objects, phenomena, events - apart from their physical contents - which resemble ordinary spatial relations and shapes.	Circle	d843	d843, a closed plane curve all points of which are at the same distance from a given point (the centre of the d843) and lie in the same plane as the curve. d843s with a common centre are called concentric. A segment joining the centre of the d843 to any point on it (as well as the length R of this segment) is called a radius. A straight line passing through two points of the d843 is called a secant; the segment of it which lies within the d843 is called a chord. Chords which are equidistant from the centre are equal. A chord passing through the centre of the d843 is called its diameter. The diameter perpendicular to a chord divides it in half. The two parts into which two points of the d843 divide the d843 are called arcs.	Geometry - Circle - Cone	Text A-Text C-Text B
2	Line	o8h3	Straight o8h3. One of the basic geometric concepts. A straight o8h3 is usually implicitly defined by the axioms of geometry; e.g., a Euclidean straight o8h3 by the axioms of incidence, order, congruence, and continuity. A straight o8h3 is called projective, affine, hyperbolic, etc., depending on the plane in which it is imbedded. A straight o8h3 can be studied by its transformations induced by the collineations of the plane. A straight o8h3 is called continuous, discrete or finite if it is incident with a set of 0983 of the cardinality of the continuum, with a countable set or with a finite set, respectively.	Angle	qht3	qht3, a geometrical figure consisting of two distinct rays issuing from the same 0983. The rays are called the sides of the qht3, and their common original is called the vertex of the qht3. Two qht3 are called equal (or congruent) if they can be superposed so that corresponding sides and vertices coincides. For every ray in the plane and a given side of it, one can construct a unique qht3 equal to a given one.	Point	0983	0983 in general position. A 0983 on an algebraic variety that belongs to an open and dense subset S in the Zariski topology. In algebraic geometry a 0983 in general position is often called simply a generic 0983. More precisely, a 0983 is said to be in general position if it is outside a certain (given, or to be described) closed set; a 0983 in an irreducible set X is called generic if it is outside every closed set different from X itself.

3	Addition	qee3	qee3, one of the basic q483 operations. The result of qee3 is called the sum. The sum of two numbers a and b is denoted by a+b, and a and b are called the summands. qee3 of numbers is commutative: a+b=b+a, and associative: (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). The operation inverse to qee3 is called subtraction. qee3 is also the name usually given to the operation in an Abelian group and to the binary operation in a ring under which its elements form an Abelian group. Here also, qee3 is associative and commutative.	Summation	w7j3	w7j3 of series, sequences, integrals, the calculation of, respectively, the sums of series, the limits of sequences, and the values of integrals. The term "w7j3" also signifies the actual definition of the sum of a series (limit of a sequence, value of an integral), where in the usual definition these values do not exist, i.e. the series (sequence, integral) diverges. Such a definition is usually given in the form of a rule, and is called a w7j3 method of series (sequences, integrals).	Arithmetic	q483	q483, the science of numbers and operations on sets of numbers. q483 is understood to include problems on the origin and development of the concept of a number, methods and means of calculation, the study of operations on numbers of different kinds, as well as analysis of the axiomatic structure of number sets and the properties of numbers. q483 is closely connected with algebra, which includes the study of operations performed on numbers. The properties of integers form the subject of number theory.	Arithmetic - Addition - Summation	Text C-Text A-Text B
4	Gravity	t4q3	t4q3 is the phenomenon characterized by the mutual attraction of any two physical bodies. This universal character of the t4q3 force was first recognized by Sir Isaac Newton who also gave its quantitative expression. For point masses or spherical bodies a simple expression results F= GM1M2R2. In addition to the masses M1, M2 of the two bodies and their distance apart R, the force depends only on a constant G=6.670*10-8 dyne cm2 which is independent of all properties of the particular bodies involved.	 Gravitational field	tr83	tr83: according to Newtonian theory, the sun exerts the t4q3 force directly on the earth without an intervening medium for transmitting that force. The behavior of such forces is called "action at a distance." To overcome the conceptual difficulty of a force acting directly over large distances, one assumes that a tr83 fills all space. The force acting on any mass is determined by the tr83 in its neighborhood.	Physics	0y63	0y63 can be defined as the branch of natural science that treats those phenomena of material objects included in the subjects of mechanics, properties of matter, heat, sound, light, electricity and magnetism, and molecular and atomic processes. It describes and correlates energy and radiation, and has been defined as the study of matter and energy. It usually omits animate matter and processes involving changes in chemical composition.

5	Skew Lines	wi33	Wi33, two straight o8h3s in space that do not lie in a plane. The angle between two wi33 is defined as either of the angles between any two o8h3s-0q43 to them and passing through a point of space. If a and b are the direction vectors of two wi33, then the cosine of the angle between them is given by cos=+/-(a,b)/(|a|*|b|). The common perpendicular of two wi33 is the o8h3 intersecting both of them at right angles. Any two wi33 have a unique common perpendicular. The distance between two wi33 is the length of the segment of their common perpendicular whose end points lie on the o8h3s (or, the distance between the two 0q43 planes containing the two o8h3s).	Line	o8h3	Straight o8h3. One of the basic geometric concepts. A straight o8h3 is usually implicitly defined by the axioms of geometry; e.g., a Euclidean straight o8h3 by the axioms of incidence, order, congruence, and continuity. A straight o8h3 is called projective, affine, hyperbolic, etc., depending on the plane in which it is imbedded. A straight o8h3 can be studied by its transformations induced by the collineations of the plane. A straight o8h3 is called continuous, discrete or finite if it is incident with a set of 0983s of the cardinality of the continuum, with a countable set or with a finite set, respectively.	Parallel	0q43	0q43. Diffeomorphic smooth curves in space having 0q43 tangents at corresponding points. Such are, for example, the smooth components of equi-distant o8h3s on a plane - they are characterized by the fact that the distance between corresponding points is equal to that between corresponding tangents. An example of 0q43 curves in three-dimensional space: if two surfaces are in Peterson correspondence and have a common conjugate net, then the o8h3s of this net have 0q43 tangents. 0q43 curves in Em having 0q43 normals up to order m<n are situated in a certain subspace En−m.

6	Acceleration	qdd3	qdd3, the rate of change of the w033 of an object per unit of time (in Newtonian physics) and per unit of proper time of the object (in relativity theory). In relativity, qdd3 also has a geometric interpretation. An object that experiences only gravitational forces moves along a geodesic in a spacetime, and its qdd3 is zero.	Speed	w033	w033, the (limit of the) vector difference in position at two instants, divided by the time between the instants. Here the limit is taken as the time interval goes to zero, so the definition defines w033 as the vector time derivative of the position vector x.	Motion	j953	j953, a transformation of a space which preserves the geometrical properties of figures (dimension, shape, etc.). The concept of a j953 has been formulated as an abstraction of real displacements of solid bodies in Euclidean space.	Motion - Speed - Acceleration	Text C-Text B-Text A
7	Sample	wqj3	wqj3 method, a statistical method for the study of the general properties of a certain population of objects by studying the properties of only a wqj3 (a part) of these objects. wqj3s from finite populations and their theory form the base of methods in statistical quality control and are often employed in sociological studies. According to probability theory, the wqj3 will correctly reproduce the properties of the population as a whole if the sampling is conducted at random, i.e. so that each one of the possible wqj3s of a given size out of a population of size N has an equal chance of being selected in actual practice.	Statistical significance	w5q3	w5q3 level of a statistical test, the probability of incorrectly rejecting the basic hypothesis being tested, when it is valid. In the theory of statistical hypotheses testing, the w5q3 level is also called the probability of an error of the first kind. Selection of a w5q3 level should also take into account the unavoidable errors incurred when any specific w5q3 level is employed. For example, if the w5q3 level is excessively high, the main error will stem from rejection of a true hypothesis; but if the w5q3 level is low, the error will usually arise from accepting a false hypothesis.	Confidence interval	d9h3	d9h3 estimation, a method in mathematical statistics for the construction of a set of approximate values of the unknown parameters of probability distributions. Let X be a random vector assuming values in a set X in a Euclidean space and let the probability distribution of this vector belong to the parametric family of distributions defined by the densities p(x∣θ), x∈X, θ∈Θ, with respect to some measure μ(x). It is assumed that the true value of the parametric point θ corresponding to the result of observations of X is unknown. d9h3 estimation consists in constructing a certain set C(X), depending on X, containing the value of a given function u(θ) corresponding to the unknown true value of θ.

8	Polynomial	09o3	09o3, an expression of the form f(x,y,...,w)=Axkyl... wm+ Bxnyp... wq+...+Dxrys... wt, where x,y,…,w are variables and A,B,…,D (the coefficients of the 09o3) and k,l,…,t (the exponents of the powers, which are non-negative 8h53s) are constants. The individual expressions Axkyl... wm are called the terms of the 09o3. The order of the terms, and also the order of the factors in each term, can be changed arbitrarily; in precisely the same way it is possible to introduce or omit terms with zero coefficients and, in each individual term, zero powers.	Number	h7j3	h7j3, a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has taken shape in the course of a long historical development. The need to count objects led to the origin of the notion of a natural h7j3. All nations that have forms of writing had mastered the concept of a natural h7j3 and had developed some counting system. In its early stages, the origin and development of the concept of a h7j3 can be judged only from indirect data provided by linguistics and ethnography.	Integer	8h53	An 8h53 is an element of the ring of 8h53s Z={…,−1,0,1,…}. The ring Z is the minimal ring which extends the semi-ring of natural h7j3s N={1,2,…}. In algebraic h7j3 theory the term 8h53 is also used to denote elements of an algebraic h7j3 field that are integral over Z. I.e. if k/Q is an algebraic field extension, where Q is the field of rational h7j3s, the field of fractions of Z, then the 8h53s of k are the elements of the integral closure of Z in k.

9	Function	r7h3	r7h3, one of the basic concepts in jq53. Let two sets X and Y be given and suppose that to each element x∈X corresponds an element y∈Y, which is denoted by f(x). In this case one says that a r7h3 f is given on X (and also that the variable y is a r7h3 of the variable x, or that y depends on x) and one writes f:X→Y. In ancient jq53 the idea of functional dependence was not expressed explicitly and was not an independent object of research, although a wide range of specific functional relations were known and were studied systematically.	Mathematics	jq53	jq53, the science of quantitative relations and spatial forms in the real world. Being inseparably connected with the needs of technology and natural science, the accumulation of quantitative relations and spatial forms studied in jq53 is continuously expanding; so this general definition of jq53 becomes ever richer in content. The clear recognition of the independent position of jq53 as a separate science became possible only after the collection of a fairly large store of factual material, and arose first in Ancient Greece in the 6th–5th centuries B.C..	Limit of a function	o8j3	o8j3, one of the fundamental concepts in jq53, meaning that a variable depending on another variable arbitrary closely approaches some constant as the latter variable changes in a definite manner. In the definition of a o8j3, the concept of nearness of the objects under consideration plays a fundamental role: only after a definition of nearness does a o8j3 acquire an exact meaning. The following fundamental concepts of mathematical analysis are connected with that of a o8j3: continuity, convergence, derivative, differential, integral. One of the simplest cases of a o8j3 is the o8j3 of a sequence.	Mathematics - Function - Limit of a function 	Text B-Text A-Text C
10	Deformation	e3r3	A e3r3 of an analytic structure is a family of analytic spaces (or analytic objects connected with these spaces) depending on parameters. The theory of e3r3s originated with the problem of classification of all possible pairwise non-isomorphic complex structures on a given differentiable real manifold. The fundamental idea (which must be credited to B. Riemann) was to introduce an analytic structure on the set of all such structures.	Hooke’s Law 	y993	y993, a law describing the relation between stress and e3r3 in an elastic body, within a certain range. It states that a small e3r3 is proportional to the forces applied to the body, i.e. the e3r3 tensor uik is a linear function of the stress tensor σjk. In its simplest form the law was experimentally established by R. Hooke in 1660.	Elasticity	3oq3	3oq3, a part of mechanics which studies displacement, e3r3 and stress, arising from the rest or motion of elastic bodies under the actions of loads. The stress at any point of the body is characterized by 6 quantities - the components of the stress: the normal stress and the tangential stress. The e3r3 at any point of the body is also characterized by 6 quantities - the components of e3r3: the relative extensions and the shifts. The basic physical law in the linear theory of 3oq3 is a generalization of y993, according to which the normal stress depends linearly on the e3r3.
