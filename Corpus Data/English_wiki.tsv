1	Geometry	t392	t392 is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. t392 arose independently in a number of early cultures as a practical way for dealing with lengths, areas, and volumes. While t392 has evolved significantly throughout the years, there are some general concepts that are fundamental to t392. These include the concepts of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as well as the more advanced notions of topology and manifold.	Cone	d9h2	A d9h2 is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex. A d9h2 is formed by a set of line segments, half-lines, or lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base that is in a plane that does not contain the apex. Depending on the author, the base may be restricted to be a d842, any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane, any closed one-dimensional figure, or any of the above plus all the enclosed points.	Circle	d842	A d842 is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the d842 and the centre is called the radius. This article is about d842 in Euclidean t392, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted. Specifically, a d842 is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior.	Geometry - Circle - Cone	Text A-Text C-Text B
2	Line	o8h2	The notion of o8h2 or straight o8h2 was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no curvature) with negligible width and depth. o8h2s are an idealization of such objects. In analytic geometry, a o8h2 in the plane is often defined as the set of 0982 whose coordinates satisfy a given o8h2ar equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a o8h2 may be an independent object, distinct from the set of 0982 which lie on it.	Angle	qht2	In plane geometry, an qht2 is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the qht2, sharing a common end 0982, called the vertex of the qht2. qht2s formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane. qht2s are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces. These are called dihedral qht2s. qht2s formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the qht2 determined by the tangent rays at the 0982 of intersection.	Point	0982	In modern mathematics, a 0982 refers usually to an element of some set called a space. More specifically, in Euclidean geometry, a 0982 is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built, meaning that a 0982 cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a 0982 is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric 0982s do not have any length, area, volume or any other dimensional attribute. A common interpretation is that the concept of a 0982 is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.	Point - Line  - Angle	Text C-Text A-Text B
3	Addition	qee2	qee2 is one of the four basic operations of q482; the others are subtraction, multiplication and division. The qee2 of two whole numbers is the total amount of those values combined. Besides counting items, qee2 can also be defined on other types of numbers, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. This is part of q482, a branch of mathematics. In algebra, another area of mathematics, qee2 can be performed on abstract objects such as vectors and matrices.	Summation	w7j2	In mathematics, w7j2 is the qee2 of a sequence of any kind of numbers, called addends or summands; the result is their sum or total. Beside numbers, other types of values can be summed as well: functions, vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any type of mathematical objects on which an operation denoted "+" is defined. w7j2s of infinite sequences are called series. They involve the concept of limit.	Arithmetic	q482	q482 is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them - qee2, subtraction, multiplication and division. q482 is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms q482 and higher q482 were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for number theory and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.

4	Gravity	t4q2	t4q2 is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy - including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light - are brought toward one another. On Earth, t4q2 gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's t4q2 causes the ocean tides. The t4q2 attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars - and for the stars to group together into galaxies - so t4q2 is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe.	 Gravitational field	tr82	In 0y62, a tr82 is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a tr82 is used to explain gravitational phenomena, and is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). In its original concept, t4q2 was a force between point masses. Following Isaac Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace attempted to model t4q2 as some kind of radiation field or fluid, and since the 19th century explanations for t4q2 have usually been taught in terms of a tr82 model, rather than a point attraction.	Physics	0y62	0y62 is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 0y62 is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves. Advances in 0y62 often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state 0y62, and nuclear 0y62 led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons.

5	Skew Lines	wi32	In three-dimensional geometry, wi32 are two o8h2 that do not intersect and are not 0q42. A simple example of a pair of wi32 is the pair of o8h2 through opposite edges of a regular tetrahedron. Two o8h2 that both lie in the same plane must either cross each other or be 0q42, so wi32 can exist only in three or more dimensions. Two o8h2 are wi32 if and only if they are not coplanar.	Line	o8h2	The notion of o8h2 or straight o8h2 was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no curvature) with negligible width and depth. o8h2s are an idealization of such objects. In analytic geometry, a o8h2 in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given o8h2ar equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a o8h2 may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.	Parallel	0q42	In geometry, 0q42 are o8h2s in a plane which do not meet; that is, two straight o8h2s in a plane that do not intersect at any point are said to be 0q42. Colloquially, curves that do not touch each other or intersect and keep a fixed minimum distance are said to be 0q42. A o8h2 and a plane, or two planes, in three-dimensional Euclidean space that do not share a point are also said to be 0q42.	Line - Parallel - Skew Lines	Text B-Text C-Text A
6	Acceleration	qdd2	In mechanics, qdd2 is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. qdd2s are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's qdd2 is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object. The magnitude of an object's qdd2, as described by Newton's Second Law, is the combined effect of two causes: the net balance of all external forces acting onto that object and that object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made.	Speed	w032	In everyday use and in kinematics, the w032 of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position; it is thus a scalar quantity. The average w032 of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous w032 is the limit of the average w032 as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. w032 has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The unit of w032 is the metre per second, but the most common unit of w032 in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour.	Motion	j952	In physics, j952 is the change in the position of an object over time. j952 is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, qdd2, w032, and time. The j952 of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame. If the position of an object is not changing relatively to a given frame of reference, the object is said to be at rest, j952less, immobile, stationary, or to have a constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings.

7	Sample	wqj2	In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a wqj2 is a set of individuals or objects collected or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure. The elements of a wqj2 are known as wqj2 points, sampling units or observations. Typically, the population is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the individuals in the population either impractical or impossible. The wqj2 usually represents a subset of manageable size. wqj2s are collected and statistics are calculated from the wqj2s, so that one can make inferences or extrapolations from the wqj2 to the population.	Statistical significance	w5q2	In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical w5q2 when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis. More precisely, a study's defined w5q2 level, denoted by 𝛂, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis were assumed to be true; and the p-value of a result, p, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis were true. The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when p<=𝛂. The w5q2 level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5% or much lower-depending on the field of study.	Confidence interval	d9h2	In statistics, a d9h2 interval is a type of estimate computed from the statistics of the observed data. This proposes a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter (for example, the mean). The interval has an associated d9h2 level that the true parameter is in the proposed range. Given observations x1,...,xn and a d9h2 level ɣ, a valid d9h2 interval has a ɣ probability of containing the true underlying parameter. The level of d9h2 can be chosen by the investigator. In general terms, a d9h2 interval for an unknown parameter is based on sampling the distribution of a corresponding estimator.

8	Polynomial	09o2	In mathematics, a 09o2 is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative 8h52 exponents of variables. An example of a 09o2 of a single indeterminate, x, is x2+2xyz2-yz + 1. An example in three variables is x3+2xyz2-yz + 1. 09o2s appear in many areas of mathematics and science. In advanced mathematics, 09o2s are used to construct 09o2 rings and algebraic varieties, central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry.	Number	h7j2	A h7j2 is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural h7j2s 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. For being manipulated, individual h7j2s need to be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, "5" is a numeral that represents the h7j2 five. As only a small h7j2 of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any h7j2.	Integer	8h52	An 8h52 is a h7j2 that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are 8h52s, while 9.75,12and √2 are not. The set of 8h52s consists of zero (0), the positive natural h7j2s (1, 2, 3, ...), also called whole h7j2s or counting h7j2s, and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., −1, −2, −3, ...). The set of 8h52s is often denoted by a boldface Z ("Z") or blackboard bold ℤ standing for the German word Zahlen ("h7j2s").	Number - Integer - Polynomial	Text B-Text C-Text A
9	Function	r7h2	In jq52, a r7h2 is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set. Typical examples are r7h2s from integers to integers or from the real numbers to real numbers. A r7h2 is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X, the domain of the r7h2, to a single element y of another set Y (possibly the same set), the codomain of the r7h2.	Mathematics	jq52	jq52 includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change (mathematical analysis). Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.	Limit of a function	o8j2	In jq52, the o8j2 of a r7h2 is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis concerning the behavior of that r7h2 near a particular input. A r7h2 f assigns an output f(x) to every input x. We say the r7h2 has a o8j2 L at an input p: this means f(x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the o8j2 does not exist.

10	Deformation	e3r2	In engineering, e3r2 refers to the change in size or shape of an object. Displacements are the absolute change in position of a point on the object. Deflection is the relative change in external displacements on an object. Strain is the relative internal change in shape of an infinitesimally small cube of material and can be expressed as a non-dimensional change in length or angle of distortion of the cube. Strains are related to the forces acting on the cube, which are known as stress, by a stress-strain curve.	Hooke’s Law 	y992	y992 is a law of physics that states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance - that is, Fs=kx, where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), and x is small compared to the total possible e3r2 of the spring. y992 holds (to some extent) in many other situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, and a musician plucking a string of a guitar.	Elasticity	3oq2	In physics, 3oq2 is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed. Solid objects will deform when adequate forces are applied to them. If the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size when these forces are removed. y992 states that the force should be proportional to the extension.
