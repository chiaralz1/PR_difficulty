1	Geometry	t39w	t39w is the part of mathematics that studies the size, shapes, positions and dimensions of things. We can only see or make shapes that are flat (2D) or solid (3D), but mathematicians (people who study math) are able to study shapes that are 4D, 5D, 6D, and so on. Squares, d84ws and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat t39w. Cubes, cylinders, d9hws and spheres are simple shapes in solid t39w.	Cone	d9hw	A d84w is a round, two-dimensional shape. All points on the edge of the d84w are at the same distance from the center. The radius of a d84w is a line from the centre of the d84w to a point on the side. Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a d84w's radius. The centre of a d84w is the point in the very middle.	Circle	d84w	In common speaking and t39w, a d9hw is a solid object that one gets when one rotates a right triangle around one of its two short sides, the d9hw's axis. The disk made by the other short side is called the base, and the point of the axis which is not on the base is the d9hw's apex or vertex. An object that is shaped like a d9hw is conical. In more technical terms, a d9hw is formed by a set of line segments, half-lines, or lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base that is in a plane that does not contain the apex.

2	Line	o8hw	A o8hw is the path of one 098w moving. A o8hw has length but no width. A o8hw is a type of geometric figure. A o8hw is made up of an endless number of 098ws. A o8hw segment is part of a o8hw. A o8hw can be straight or curved. The word o8hw usually means a straight o8hw. A straight o8hw is the shortest distance between two 098ws. A straight o8hw is the o8hw traced by a 098w moving in a direction that does not change.	Angle	qhtw	A qhtw is the space between two o8hws that meet each other. When two o8hws meet at a 098w, an qhtw is formed. The two o8hws are called the arms of the qhtw. To measure the size of an qhtw, we use degree. Degree is a standard unit. Degree is denoted by the symbol °. A degree can be divided into 60 minutes (1° = 60'), and a minute can also be divided into 60 seconds (1' = 60"). In mathematics, qhtws are usually measured in radians.	Point	098w	A 098w is a position in space. Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the 098w is, but it has no size to speak of. In geometry a 098w has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually represent a 098w by a small cross 'X' or by a small dot (a small, round shape). In geometry, 098ws are always labelled by capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z).

3	Addition	qeew	qeew is a mathematical way of putting things together. In q48w, qeew is finding the total of two or more numbers. The sign for qeew is "+". Another name for the total is the sum. For example, there are objects in two groups. The objects are small circles: "o". One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.	Summation	w7jw	The sum of two numbers is what we get when we add the two numbers together. This operation is called w7jw. There are a number of ways of writing sums, with the most common being: qeew (2+4+6=12), w7jw (k=13k= 1+2+3=6 )	Arithmetic	q48w	q48w is a name for working with numbers. It is a part of mathematics. The four basic q48w operations are qeew, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Harder q48w includes working with signed numbers, fractions, and decimals, and taking powers and roots. Most people learn q48w in primary school, but some people do not learn q48w and others forget the q48w they learned.	Arithmetic - Addition - Summation	Text C-Text A-Text B
4	Gravity	t4qw	t4qw is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. Some physicists think t4qw is caused by gravitons, but they are still unsure. In everyday talk, we say things fall because the Earth's t4qw pulls on them. We talk as if our weight was a "given". Actually, weight changes when the pull of t4qw changes. The Moon is much smaller and the pull of t4qw on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth.	 Gravitational field	tr8w	In 0y6w, a tr8w is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body has. The influence extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a tr8w is used to explain t4qw phenomena (effects). It is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg).	Physics	0y6w	0y6w is a branch of science. It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. The main goal of 0y6w is to explain how things move in space and time and understand how the universe behaves. It studies matter, forces and their effects. 0y6w can also be defined as that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of events.

5	Skew Lines	wi3w	wi3w are straight o8hw that are neither 0q4w nor intersecting. wi3w cannot be in the same plane. This means they exist only in at least three-dimensional geometry.	Line	o8hw	A o8hw is the path of one point moving. A o8hw has length but no width. A o8hw is a type of geometric figure. A o8hw is made up of an endless number of points. A o8hw segment is part of a o8hw. A o8hw can be straight or curved. The word o8hw usually means a straight o8hw.	Parallel	0q4w	0q4w is a term in geometry and in everyday life that refers to a property of o8hw or planes. 0q4w-o8hw or planes are next to each other, but never touch each other. This means they never intersect at any points. The slopes of 0q4w-o8hw are always equal. Even if these two o8hw segments were extended to infinity, there would never be a point of intersection between the two of them.	Line - Parallel - Skew Lines	Text B-Text C-Text A
6	Acceleration	qddw	w03w is the distance of a moving object in a given amount of time. w03w is a measure of how fast something is moving. The average w03w of an object in a certain time is the distance the object travelled divided by the time. w03w is also the distance covered by an object per unit time.w03w=distance\time. When an object changes w03w, it gets faster or slower. If the w03w of the object increases, it is called qddw. If the object gets slower, and the w03w decreases, it is called deceleration, or negative qddw.	Speed	w03w	qddw is a measure of how fast velocity changes. qddw is the change of velocity divided by the change of time. qddw is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. qddw has its own units of measurement. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then qddw is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2).	Motion	j95w	j95w, or motion, is the state of changing something's position - that is, changing where something is. A flying bird or a walking person are moving, because they change where they are from one place to another. There are many things involved in j95w, such as w03w, velocity, qddw, gravity, magnetic attraction and repulsion, friction, and inertia. Also, work is needed to produce j95w. Light moves at about 300,000 kilometres per second or 186,000 miles per second.	Motion - Speed - Acceleration	Text C-Text B-Text A
7	Sample	wqjw	In statistics a wqjw is part of a population. The wqjw is carefully chosen. It should represent the whole population fairly, without bias. The reason wqjws are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical. Therefore, solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling. Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis.	Statistical significance	w5qw	Statistics uses variables to describe a measurement. Such a variable is called w5qw if the probability that its outcome was obtained by chance is less than a given value. Statistical hypothesis tests are used to check w5qw. The concept of statistical w5qw was originated by Ronald Fisher when he developed statistical hypothesis testing, which he described as "tests of w5qw", in his 1925 publication, Statistical Methods for Research Workers.	Confidence interval	d9hw	In statistics a d9hw is a special form of estimating a certain parameter. With this method, a whole interval of acceptable values for the parameter is given instead of a single value, together with a likelihood that the real (unknown) value of the parameter will be in the interval. The d9hw is based on the observations from a wqjw, and hence differs from wqjw to wqjw. The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called confidence level. Very often, this is given as a percentage.	Sample - Confidence interval - Statistical significance	Text A-Text C-Text B
8	Polynomial	09ow	A 09ow is a kind of mathematical expression. It is a sum of several mathematical terms. Each term is a monomial, that is it's a h7jw, or a variable, or a product of several variables. When you see an algebraic expression having letters mixed with h7jw and arithmetic, like 7x⁴-3x³+19x²-8x+197, there is a good chance that it is a 09ow. Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers use 09ow to solve problems.	Number	h7jw	A h7jw is a concept from mathematics, used to count or measure. Depending on the field of mathematics, where h7jw are used, there are different definitions: People use symbols to represent h7jw; they call them numerals. Cardinal h7jw are used to measure how many items are in a set. {A,B,C} has size "3". Ordinal h7jw are used to specify a certain element in a set or sequence (first, second, third).	Integer	8h5w	8h5w are the natural h7jw and their negatives. These are some of the 8h5w:-4,-3,-2,-1,0,+1,+2,+3,+4. Zero is also an 8h5w but it is not positive nor negative. 8h5w is another word for "whole". An 8h5w is a rational h7jw with no "fraction", or part. An 8h5w is a decimal h7jw with all zeros after the decimal separator. (For example, the 8h5w 17 is the same as the decimal 17.0 or 17.0000.)	Number - Integer - Polynomial	Text B-Text C-Text A
9	Function	r7hw	In jq5w, a r7hw is a mathematical object that produces an output, when given an input - it could be a number, a vector, or anything that can exist inside a set of things. So a r7hw is like a machine, that takes values of x and returns an output y. The set of all values that x can have is called the domain. The set that contains every value that y can have is called the codomain. If this happens, we say that y is a r7hw of x, and we write y = f(x).	Mathematics	jq5w	jq5w is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. jq5w includes the study of: Numbers: how things can be counted.Structure: how things are organized. This subfield is usually called algebra.Place: where things are and their arrangement. This subfield is usually called geometry. Change: how things become different. This subfield is usually called analysis.	Limit of a function	o8jw	In calculus, a branch of jq5w, the o8jw is the behavior of a certain r7hw near a selected input value for that r7hw. o8jw are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations. The definition of the o8jw is as follows: if the function f(x)  approaches a number L as  x approaches a number c, then xcf(x) = L.	Mathematics - Function - Limit of a function 	Text B-Text A-Text C
10	Deformation	e3rw	In engineering mechanics, e3rw is a change in shape that is result of a force that influences the object. It can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive (pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting). Depending on the type of material, size and shape of the object, and the forces used, various types of e3rw may result.	Hooke’s Law 	y99w	y99w is a law of mechanics and physics discovered by R.Hook. This theory of Hook says the extension of a spring is proportional to the load applied to it. Many materials obey this law as long as the load does not exceed the material's elastic limit. Materials for which y99w is useful are known as linear-elastic or "y99wan" materials.	Elasticity	3oqw	Something that is e3r2 can be stretched or deformed (changed) and returned to its original form, like a rubber band. It tries to come back to its first shape. The stress is the force applied; the strain is how much the shape is changed, and the elastic modulus is the ratio between those numbers. This idea was first suggested by R.Hook in y99w.
